This project contains formalizations of some of the introductory results of mathematical logic.

Goals achieved:
* Tukey's Lemma.
* Soundness and Completeness of classical propositional logic.
* Ultrafilter Lemma.

Goals remaining:
* Soundness and Completeness of intuitionistic propositional logic with respect to Heyting semantics.
* Soundness and Completeness of first order logic.
* Löwenheim–Skolem theorem.
* Łoś's theorem and Compactness.
